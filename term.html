                      <H3>  PRODUCT & SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS</H3>
                       <p> Whilst we try to display the colors of our products accurately on the Website, the actual colors you see will depend on your screen and we cannot guarantee that your screen's display of any color will accurately reflect the color of the product on delivery.
                        
                            All items are subject to availability. We will inform you as soon as possible if the product(s) or service(s) you have ordered are not available and we may offer an alternative product(s) or service(s) of equal or higher quality and value otherwise the order had to be canceled.
                            </p>
                   <h3>     ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR ORDER</h3>
                       <p> Please note that completion of the online checkout process does not constitute our acceptance of your order. Our acceptance of your order will take place only when we dispatch the product(s) or commencement of the services that you ordered from us.
                        
                            If you supplied us with your email address when entering your payment details (or if you have a registered account with us), we will notify you by email as soon as possible to confirm that we have received your order.
                            
                            All products that you order through the Website will remain the property of J. until we have received payment in full from you for those products.
                            
                            If we cannot supply you with the product or service you ordered, we will not process your order. We will inform you via email or call, if you have already paid for the product or service, refund you in full as soon as reasonably possible.
                            </p>
                     <h3>   DELIVERY OF YOUR ORDER</h3>
                       <p> J. products are sold on a delivery duty unpaid basis. The recipient may have to pay import duty or a formal customs entry fee prior to or on delivery. Additional taxes, fees or levies may apply according to local legislation and customers are required to check these details before placing an order for international delivery.
                        
                        We will deliver to the home or office address indicated by you when you place an order.
                        We cannot deliver to PO boxes. All deliveries must be signed for upon receipt. We will try at least twice to deliver your order at the address indicated by you.
                        
                        We reserve the right to cancel your purchase in the event nobody is available to sign for receipt.
                        You bear the risk for the products once delivery is completed.
                        
                        Where possible, we try to deliver in one go. We reserve the right to split the delivery of your order, for instance (but not limited to) if part of your order is delayed or unavailable. In the event that we split your order, we will notify you of our intention to do so by sending you an e-mail to the e-mail address provided by you at the time of purchase. You will not be charged for any additional delivery costs.
                        
                        We can entertain any changes to order provided if the order isn't dispatched yet. We will not be able to accept any order change requests once the order is dispatched (neither any refund or exchange will be possible in case of delivery outside Pakistan.) 
                       </p>
